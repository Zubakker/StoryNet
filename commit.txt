add new design for base.html and post_detail.html, add static dirs

In base.html I added circle links on the left as well as put the con-
tent block in the middle of the page. All the changes are located in
/static/styles/base.css, and pictures are located in /static/images

In post_detail.html I created a page block with fixed aspect ratio, 
where the text will be located. All the styles are in
/posts/static/styles/post_detail.css and the scripts are in
/posts/static/javascript/post_detai.js
